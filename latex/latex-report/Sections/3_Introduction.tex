In recent years, using machine learning to solve quantum mechanical systems has become of great interest for many. Recently, representing wave functions as a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) has also recently been presented by G. Carleo and M. Troyer where they applied it to quantum machanical spin lattice system of the Ising model and Heisenberg model [1]. In this project, we will apply the RBM to a system with of two interacting electrons (or bosons) confined in a harmonic oscillator trap. The wave function of the system can be formulated as an artificial neural network, which is called the Neural-Network Quantum State (NQS), can be represented using the RBM.

We will test our implementation against a Variational Monte Carlo method with optimization algorithms such as ADAM (which will also be used to find an upper limit for the ground state?)

As quantum mechanical systems become more complex, it becomes exponentially harder to solve the problem numerically, and only the simplest of models have an analytical solution.
